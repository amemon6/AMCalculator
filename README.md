# Calculator+

This calculator is very basic and only handles order of operations with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

To use the calculator, press buttons to create an expression, then hit the equals button to evaluate the expression and receive the answer. Know that building an incorrectly formatted expression will lead to the program crashing. Syntax and Logical errors such as 2 operators in a row or dividing by 0 will crash the program.

Additonal functionality to be added in the future:
- proper error handling
- exponents
- negative number functionality (you are currently unable to multiply or divide by negative numbers)

Input the equation you wish to evaluate
